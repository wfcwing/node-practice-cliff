Creating a Script
Node.js scripts are created with the js file extension. Remember that Node.js is not a
programming language. All the code in this course is JavaScript code, which is why the js
extension is used.

Running a Script
You can run a Node.js script using the node command. Open up a new terminal window
and navigate to the directory where the script lives. From the terminal, you can use the
node command to provide the path to the script that should run. You can see an example
of this command in the terminal below.
